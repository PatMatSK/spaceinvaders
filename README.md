(Original description of game can be found in Slovak Language in zadani.txt)

This is a Space Invaders arcade game. With the help of our ship, we try to shoot down the enemy army.
We have obstacles to help, but they are damaged by both our and enemy missiles. We start with 3 lives.
After the elimination of the enemy army, another one arrives. After hitting the enemy there is a 50% chance for a bonus,
which can suspend enemies for a certain time, give us a shield (one extra life) or fix them all
damaged obstacles (those completely destroyed will not be returned to us). We always have a shield effective for only one troop. You need to be careful
but also put it on the enemies, because they can shoot, and more often every round. Enemy army
it slowly progresses lower. Although our battleship has the most advanced technology, we cannot fool physics and that is why
starting from a place or stopping immediately will be a subtle challenge. For shooting down the enemy, we get more points each round,
and for the elimination of the entire regiment 100. With the incoming troops, our obstacles also weaken. We are able to fix obstacles
only to the state they were in when the enemy regiment arrived. The state of the obstacles is not renewed when the next one arrives
waves of enemies.

We move with the keys 'a' and 'd' and shoot with the space bar. After finishing, we can register in the table
top 5 players (if necessary) and we will choose whether we want to continue.

In the game we have various objects that differ in functionality, but they all have coordinates, a window in which to work,
they can display themselves and tell if they are located on a given coordinate. In the game we have several types of enemies, each one shoots
and moves differently.
