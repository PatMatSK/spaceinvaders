Project was created in one file and at the end separated to separate files.
I used this method because I had problems with linking so I solved this at the end.
This repository is not to save every single change but comprehensive versions.
Examples directory contain example.sh script which can be used to show a few features. 
Game in examples is simplyfied to demonstrate some feature.
